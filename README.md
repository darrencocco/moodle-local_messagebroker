### Moodle Message Broker
Provides a conduit for message queues to feed messages into Moodle instances.

Connector sub-plugins provide the ability to consume messages from other
sources. Out of the box there is a web service that allows other systems
to POST messages with a topic to the Moodle system.

Future functionality is expected to support STOMP, AMQP and SQS.
